# Food Delivery App Backend

This is the backend code for a Food Delivery app. It allows users to register, login, view restaurants and their menus, place orders, and manage their account.

The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as the database. It follows the RESTful API architecture and uses JWT for authentication.

## Features

- User registration: Users can register by providing their name, email, password, and address.
- User login: Registered users can login using their email and password to obtain a JWT token.
- Password reset: Users can reset their password by providing their current password and a new password.
- Restaurant listing: Users can view a list of all available restaurants.
- Restaurant details: Users can view the details of a specific restaurant, including its address and menu.
- Menu management: Restaurant owners can add new items to their menu and delete existing menu items.
- Order placement: Users can place an order by selecting items from a restaurant's menu and providing their delivery address.
- Order details: Users can view the details of a specific order, including the ordered items, total price, and delivery status.
- Order status update: Restaurant owners can update the status of an order to indicate its progress (e.g., preparing, on the way, delivered).
